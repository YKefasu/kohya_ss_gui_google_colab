# Kohya SS GUI (Google Colab)

This Colab workbook sets up a Kohya SS instance on Colab and provides a link to access the Kohya WebUI on Gradio Live. Kohya SS is a Python library that provides Stable Diffusion-based models for image, text, and audio generation tasks. This Colab workbook provides a convenient way for users to run Kohya SS without needing to install anything on their local machine.

This workbook was inspired by the work of [Spaceginner](https://github.com/Spaceginner)'s original Colab workbook and the [Kohya SS project](https://github.com/bmaltais/kohya_ss) by [bmaltais](https://github.com/bmaltais). The Colab workbook was coded by [panguin6010](https://github.com/panguin6010) and Edited by [YKefasu](https://github.com/YKefasu)
